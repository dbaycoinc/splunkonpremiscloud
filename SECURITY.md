## Handling Vulnerabilities

### **Process**
- Upon receiving a report, we will:
  1. Verify the vulnerability.
  2. Assess its severity.
  3. Develop a fix and prepare necessary updates.

### **Public Disclosure**
- Vulnerabilities will **not be disclosed publicly** until a fix has been implemented and tested.
- Once resolved, we will issue a security advisory and update the affected components or versions.

### **Coordinated Disclosure**
- We value and encourage responsible disclosure practices.
- Contributors reporting vulnerabilities will be credited in the advisory unless they request anonymity.

## Guidelines for Secure Development

### **Secrets Management**
- Use encrypted environment variables or tools like **AWS Secrets Manager** or **Splunk Secure Credential Store** for sensitive information.
- Avoid hardcoding credentials in source code.

### **Dependency Management**
- Keep dependencies up-to-date using tools like `dependabot` or `pip-tools`.
- Review dependency security advisories regularly.

### **Infrastructure**
- Follow **least privilege principles** for IAM roles in Terraform configurations.
- Use encrypted storage (e.g., S3 buckets with encryption enabled) for sensitive data.

## Security Features in the Project

- **Infrastructure Hardening**:
  - Terraform modules follow best practices for VPC, NACLs, and security group configurations.
- **Python Code Security**:
  - Code follows PEP8 and avoids insecure patterns like eval().
- **CI/CD Pipeline Security**:
  - Secrets are stored securely using GitHub Actions secrets.
  - Linting tools ensure code quality before deployment.
